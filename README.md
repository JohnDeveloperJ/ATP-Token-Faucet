# ATP Token Faucet - README

## Overview
Welcome to the ATP Token Faucet! This repository contains the smart contract code and deployment scripts for a simple yet efficient ERC-20 token faucet for ATP (Advanced Technology Protocol) tokens. Our faucet is designed to allow users to easily claim a small amount of ATP tokens, which can be used for testing, development purposes, or initial engagement within the ATP ecosystem.

## Features
- **Token Claim**: Users can claim a predefined amount of ATP tokens after a specified cooldown period.
- **Cooldown Management**: Enforces a cooldown period between claims to prevent abuse.
- **Secure and Efficient**: Utilizes OpenZeppelin contracts for standard compliance and enhanced security.
- **Owner Privileges**: The contract owner can supply the faucet with tokens and withdraw them if necessary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) for smart contract compilation and deployment
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet or any other Ethereum wallet setup for interaction
- Ethereum in the wallet for gas fees (if deploying to a live network)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/atp-token-faucet.git
   cd atp-token-faucet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts**
   ```sh
   truffle compile
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Create a `.env` file** and configure your wallet's private key and Infura API key (or any other Ethereum node provider):

   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
   ```

2. **Run Migration**
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --network ropsten
   ```

   _Note: Replace `ropsten` with the network of your choice._

## Usage

After deploying your faucet contract:

1. **Fund the Faucet**: Transfer some ATP tokens to the contract address.
2. **Claim Tokens**: Users can interact with the contract to claim tokens based on the defined rules.
3. **Monitor & Manage**: The contract owner should monitor and manage the faucet's token balance and adjust settings as needed.
